# Welcome to Test-MkDocs

This is a basic mkdocs website. I am testing it fairly quick, with the hopes to use it for a project.

This website is also going to include documentation on how to contribute. If you have any questions,
please contact Dale.

## Documentation:

You can fork this project to your desktop, make changes and commit them. This is a GROUP project, IF
you are reading this.. it's meant for you.

Go ahead, clone it.. or fork it!

`git clone ...`


## Commands

* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

## Project layout
